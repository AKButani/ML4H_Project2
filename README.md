All files for Part 1 are inside the folder "heart_failure". All results can be obtained by running the Jupyter notebook: "part1_combined"

For part 2, the 2 CNNs have been uploaded to the folder part2_models. This way, the notebook for part 2 can be run by loading the model (faster). 
For training the CNNs, the 2 booleans can be set to True: bool_train_ran and bool_train_cnn
