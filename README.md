All files for Part 1 are inside the folder "heart_failure". All results can be obtained by running the Jupyter notebook: "part1_combined.ipynb"

For part 2, the 2 CNNs have been uploaded to the folder part2_models. This way, the notebook for part 2, "Part2_combined_finished.ipynb", can be run by loading the model (faster). 
For training the CNNs, the 2 booleans can be set to True: bool_train_ran and bool_train_cnn.

All files were ultimately run in the laptop but since no relative paths were used, with the requirement file, it should be possible to run it in the cluster.
